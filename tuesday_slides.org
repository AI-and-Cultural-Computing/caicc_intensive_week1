* Welcome

Hi everyone, welcome to our first official session as a team
* Agenda

 + Cover readings
 + Discussion of machine learning
 + Going over preparation for coding
 + Find out what people want next!
* Readings
Core readings:

 + You Look Like a Thing Intro -- ch 3
 + AI:AMA ch1
 + Phantasmal Media preface
 + 3b1b intro video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk

What else did people bring? Drop links in the Slack!

 + 
* Setting the stage
 + What is AI?
   + 
 + What is machine learning?
   + 
 + What is /deep/ learning?
   + 
 + What does /learning/ mean here?
   + 
* You Look Like a Thing

 My favorite part of the introduction
#+begin_quote
The Five Principles of AI Weirdness:

 + The danger of AI is not that it’s too smart but that it’s not smart enough.
 + AI has the approximate brainpower of a worm.
 + AI does not really understand the problem you want it to solve.
 + But: AI will do exactly what you tell it to. Or at least it will try its best.
 + And AI will take the path of least resistance.

 Other thoughts: 
 + The problem with sheep (correlative errors)
 + Automating job screenings
 + Recommendations are /mostly harmless/ (https://www.npr.org/2022/10/09/1127686507/amazon-suicide-teenagers-poison)
 + Transformers were brand new when this book was published!
 + Hints at interpretability problem

* AI: AMA ch 1

 rationalist vs human-like

 thoughts vs behavior

 AI combines
 + computability
 + cognitive science
 + neuroscience
 + economics
 + cybernetics
 + &c.
   
* A super aside: computation has limits

 + Computers can't do everything
 + Computers can't do most things, in a technical sense
 + Cardinality
 + Finite time, finite data, finite instructions
* An aside: everything is numbers

 + Machine learning is an incredible hammer
 + Using it means getting better at turning things into nails
 + Much of machine learning is about taking data and turning it into numbers
* Phantasmal Media

His personal journey towards computation, art, and the importance of bringing subjectivity into computation

* Getting started with notebooks and colab

* What is Git/GitHub?

 + a tool for tracking changes and collaborative work
 + basically /the/ tool for sharing projects

* Reading pace?

 How was the pace this past week?

 Next week is more "choose your own adventure"
 
 Proposed Reading/viewing for next week:

 - Core material
   - Data Conscience chs 1-3
   - You Look Like a Thing chs 4-6
     
 - Ethical issues of training diffusion models
   - Articles on the potential of large language models

 - More on neural networks
    - Make your own neural network pgs 1 - 19
      
 - Mathematical background
   - Mathematics for Machine Learning ch 1
   - Thinking Bayes ch 1

 - Even more on Python
   - Python for Data Analysis ch 1 & ch 2

* Next time

 + our case studies:
   + transformers
   + stable diffusion
 + discussion
 + station will give a demo of their own work teaching ML at PCC!
 + suggestions?
