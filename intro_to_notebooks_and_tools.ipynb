So, in this section, we're going to be giving a very quick overview of some of the core concepts of Python. This isn't comprehensive by any means, we just want to introduce a little bit of bootstrapping knowledge so you can at least read code you see in other examples and get the gist of what's happening.\n",

Python, like English, is read left-to-right and up-to-down even by the computer. \n",
